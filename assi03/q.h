@brief
This file contains the declaration of function temp_converter.
*//*______________________________________________________________________*/

// @todo: Provide function-level documentation header as explained in Assignment 2 specs ...
// It is important that you provide function-level documentation header in
// this [header] file since this file is what you would provide to your
// clients and other users to solve problems related to conversions of
// temperature from Fahrenheit scale to other scales. In a commercial environment,
// the source file q.c containing the definition of function temp_converter is
// your intellectual property and should therefore be kept private. Instead,
// you'll provide your clients the object file q.o [obtained by only compiling q.c].
// Therefore, your clients will know how to use the function temp_converter
// only by reading this function-level documentation header ...

// @todo: Now, provide the declaration or prototype of function temp_converter
// that takes a parameter of type int and returns nothing ...

void temp_converter(int f);
